# 💰 Loan Approval Prediction

Predict whether a **loan will be approved** based on applicant information such as **CIBIL score, income, assets, loan amount, tenure, and education** using **machine learning**. This project helps identify key factors affecting loan approval and predicts loan status for new applicants.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project was developed using                     **Anaconda**.

---

## 📊 Features

* Analyze **financial and personal details** of applicants
* Explore **relationships between variables** using data visualization
* Predict **loan approval** using **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest classifiers**
* Identify **key factors** like CIBIL score, assets, income, and loan parameters

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* **Python** (via **Anaconda**)
* **Pandas & NumPy** – data manipulation
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – data visualization
* **Scikit-learn** – machine learning models
* **Jupyter Notebook** – interactive analysis

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains applicant financial and personal information, including **CIBIL score, income, employment status, loan details, assets, and loan status**.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open **Anaconda Navigator** and launch **Jupyter Notebook**
2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-link>
   ```

3. Open the notebook and run cells to **explore data and predict loan approvals**

## 📈 Machine Learning Models

* **Decision Tree Classifier** – Accuracy: 91.4%
* **Random Forest Classifier** – Accuracy: 89.4%
* **Conclusion:** Decision Tree performs slightly better and is highly interpretable.

---

## ✨ Key Takeaways

* Higher **CIBIL score** → higher chance of loan approval ✅
* More **assets** → higher chance of loan approval 🏠💎
* Higher **income** and shorter **loan tenure** → higher chance of approval 💵
* Machine learning can **predict loan approval** and assist banks in prioritizing applicants 📊
